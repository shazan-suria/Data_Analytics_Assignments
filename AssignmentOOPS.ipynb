    "\n",
    "# Abstraction is about hiding the complexity of a system by providing a simplified interface. \n",
    "# It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How It Works: \n",
    "# Abstraction involves creating simple, easy-to-use representations of more complex underlying code. \n",
    "# It allows programmers to work with high-level concepts without worrying about low-level details.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# In a car, you use a steering wheel, pedals, and buttons to control the vehicle without\n",
    "# needing to understand the internal mechanics of the engine or transmission. \n",
    "# In programming, interfaces and abstract classes are common ways to achieve abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose:\n",
    "# Encapsulation is about bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that\n",
    "# data into a single unit (a class) and restricting access to some of the object's components.\n",
    "# It helps in protecting the data from outside interference and misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How It Works: \n",
    "# Encapsulation is implemented through access modifiers (like private, protected, and public in languages such as Java or C++).\n",
    "# In Python, encapsulation is achieved through conventions (like prefixing attributes with underscores) and property decorators.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# In a class representing a bank account, the balance attribute might be private,\n",
    "# and access to it would be controlled through public methods like deposit and withdraw.\n",
    "# This ensures that the balance can only be modified in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self.account_number = account_number\n",

    "# Key Benefits of Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code Reusability:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism promotes code reuse by allowing the same interface to be used for different underlying forms (data types).\n",

    "# Dynamic Method Binding (Runtime Polymorphism):-\n",
    "# Polymorphism allows for dynamic method binding, where the method to be invoked is determined at runtime based\n",

    "\n",
    "# Improved Readability and Maintainability:-\n",

    "# Key Advantages of OOP:\n",
    "# Modularity:\n",
    "# OOP allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces called classes and objects.\n",
    "# This modularity makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code Reusability:\n",
    "# With inheritance, you can create new classes that reuse, extend,\n",
    "# and modify the behavior defined in existing classes. This reduces code duplication and enhances code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation:\n",
    "# Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of an object and exposing only the necessary methods to interact with the object.\n",
    "# This protects the data from outside interference and misuse, ensuring better data security.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction:\n",
    "# Abstraction allows you to create simple and high-level interfaces for complex systems by hiding unnecessary details. \n",
    "# This makes it easier to work with complex systems by focusing on essential features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism:\n",
    "# Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "# It allows for dynamic method binding at runtime, meaning the appropriate method is called based on the actual object's type, enhancing flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Maintainability:\n",
    "# OOP promotes the development of maintainable code by organizing it into well-structured classes and objects.\n",
    "# This organization makes it easier to update and extend the codebase over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extensibility:\n",
    "# OOP makes it easy to add new functionality to existing code. New classes can be created to extend the behavior of existing ones without modifying the original code, \n",
    "# reducing the risk of introducing bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Improved Collaboration:\n",
    "# OOP facilitates collaboration among developers by allowing different team members to work on different classes or modules independently. \n",
    "# This division of labor enhances productivity and efficiency in large projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example for Illustration:\n",

    "# Key Concepts of Polymorphism with Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance:\n",
    "# A subclass inherits methods and attributes from a parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The subclass can override methods of the parent class to provide specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method Overriding:\n",
    "# Subclasses can provide their own implementation of methods defined in the parent class. This allows different subclasses to have different behaviors for the same method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Common Interface:\n",
    "# Polymorphism allows a common interface to be used for different types of objects. This is achieved through method overriding and the use of inheritance.\n",

    "# Method chaining in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the technique of calling multiple methods on the same object sequentially in a single statement.\n",
